## LeetCode Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository! 

This repository is a collection of solutions to various LeetCode problems I've tackled. I aim to share my approaches, thought processes, and potential optimizations for each challenge. Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and contribute your own solutions!

**What to Expect:**

- **Random LeetCode Problems:** I'll be adding solutions to a diverse range of LeetCode problems, focusing on different data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.
- **Clear and Concise Solutions:** The code will be well-structured, commented, and easy to understand. 
- **Explanatory Notes:** Where necessary, I'll provide additional notes or explanations to clarify specific steps or concepts in the solution.
- **Multiple Approaches (Optional):** If there are alternative solutions for a problem, I might showcase different approaches with their pros and cons.
- **Continuous Learning:** This repository is a work in progress. I'll keep adding new solutions and potentially revisit existing ones to improve them as I learn and grow.
